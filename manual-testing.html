                    <!-- <p>Bootstrap is a versatile toolkit that includes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript tools for creating and developing web pages and applications. It is a free and open-source project that was built by (and for) Twitter and is hosted on GitHub.</p>
                    <p>While working at Twitter, Mark Otto and Jacob Thornton created and announced Bootstrap in August 2011. The goal of the project was to make interface creation and maintenance as simple and uniform as possible. Bootstrap was a way to
                        make several popular design patterns a standard in online design and development, not just a framework. The project was originally known as Twitter Blueprint, but it was eventually renamed Bootstrap and distributed as an open-source
                        project. The project is still being maintained by the same folks, with the help of a big community of Github contributors.</p> -->

                    <!-- <p>Bootstrap gained tremendous popularity after its open-source release in 2011, and for good reason. Bootstrap is popular among web designers and developers because it is versatile and simple to use. Its key advantages are that it is
                        responsive by design, that it supports a wide range of browsers, that it provides a consistent design by employing reusable components, and that it is simple to use and understand. It comes with built-in support for jQuery plugins
                        and a programmatic JavaScript API for rich extensibility via JavaScript. Any IDE or editor, as well as any server-side technology and language, can be utilized with Bootstrap.</p> -->
