                    <p>Bootstrap is a versatile toolkit that includes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript tools for creating and developing web pages and applications. It is a free and open-source project that was built by (and for) Twitter and is hosted on GitHub.</p>
                    <p>While working at Twitter, Mark Otto and Jacob Thornton created and announced Bootstrap in August 2011. The goal of the project was to make interface creation and maintenance as simple and uniform as possible. Bootstrap was a way to
                        make several popular design patterns a standard in online design and development, not just a framework. The project was originally known as Twitter Blueprint, but it was eventually renamed Bootstrap and distributed as an open-source
                        project. The project is still being maintained by the same folks, with the help of a big community of Github contributors.</p>
                    <p>Bootstrap gained tremendous popularity after its open-source release in 2011, and for good reason. Bootstrap is popular among web designers and developers because it is versatile and simple to use. Its key advantages are that it is
                        responsive by design, that it supports a wide range of browsers, that it provides a consistent design by employing reusable components, and that it is simple to use and understand. It comes with built-in support for jQuery plugins
                        and a programmatic JavaScript API for rich extensibility via JavaScript. Any IDE or editor, as well as any server-side technology and language, can be utilized with Bootstrap.</p>
                    <h1>Bootstrap Interview Questions for Freshers</h1>
                    <h2>1. What are the advantages of Bootstrap?</h2>
                    <p>The following are some advantages of Bootstrap:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Bootstrap is simple to use and anyone with a basic understanding of HTML and CSS can get started.
                        </li>
                        <li>Features that adapt to phones, tablets, and desktops: Bootstrap's responsive CSS adapts to phones, tablets, and desktops.</li>
                        <li>A mobile-first strategy: Mobile-first styles are built into the Bootstrap framework.</li>
                        <li>Bootstrap 4 is compatible with all modern browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer 10+, Edge, Safari, and Opera.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>2. What is a Bootstrap Container, and how does it work?</h2>
                    <p>A bootstrap container is a handy class that generates a central region on the page where we can put our site content. The bootstrap .container has the advantage of being responsive and containing all of our other HTML code. Containers
                        are used to pad the content within them, and there are two types of containers:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The .container class creates a fixed-width container that is responsive.</li>
                        <li>The .container-fluid class creates a full-width container that spans the entire viewport width.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>3. What are the default Bootstrap text settings?</h2>
                    <p>The default font size in Bootstrap 4 is 16px, with a line-height of 1.5.</p>
                    <p>The default font family is "Helvetica Neue," which includes Helvetica, Arial, and other sans-serif fonts.
                    </p>
                    <p>Margin-top: 0 and margin-bottom: 1rem are also set on all &lt;p&gt; elements (16px by default)</p>

                    <h2>4. What do you know about the Bootstrap Grid System?</h2>
                    <p>The Bootstrap Grid System is a mobile-first, responsive grid system that scales up to 12 columns as the device or viewport size grows. Predefined classes for quick layout options and powerful mix-ins for creating successful semantic
                        layouts are included in the system.</p>
                    <p>There are five classes in the Bootstrap 4 grid system:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>.col- for extra small devices, whose screen width is less than 576px.</li>
                        <li>.col-sm- small devices, whose screen width is equal to or greater than 576px.</li>
                        <li>.col-md- medium devices, whose screen width is equal to or greater than 768px.</li>
                        <li>.col-lg- large devices, whose screen width is equal to or greater than 992px.</li>
                        <li>.col-xl- extra large devices, whose screen width is equal to or greater than 1200px.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The classes listed above can be combined to build layouts that are more dynamic and adaptable.</p>
